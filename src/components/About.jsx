      NYU was founded on the belief that a studentâ€™s identity should not dictate the ability for them to access higher education. That sense of opportunity for all students, of all backgrounds, remains a part of who we are today and a critical part of what makes us a world class university. Our community embraces diversity, in all its forms, as a cornerstone of the NYU experience. 
      We would like to better understand how your experiences would help us to shape and grow our diverse community. Please respond in 250 words or less.
